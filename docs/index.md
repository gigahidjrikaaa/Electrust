## Problem
The current Indonseian voting system is not transparent and is prone to fraud. It is also not efficient and is not environmentally friendly, not secure and is prone to hacking. There are lots of plans to improve the voting system, but there is no stable solution for the problem yet.

## Problem Statement
1. How to make a more cost-effective voting system?
2. How to make a more secure voting system?
3. How to make a more transparent voting system while still maintaining voter privacy?

## Solution
We are developing a blockchain-based voting system that is more secure, transparent, and cost-effective. We are using Cardano blockchain to ensure the integrity of the voting process. We are also using a hybrid blockchain system to ensure voter privacy.

## Target Market
1. Indonesian Government
2. Student Bodies in Indonesia
